# Reliance Foundation AI Analytics Platform - Refactor & Improvements

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyze entire codebase and identify issues
- [x] Create comprehensive improvement plan
- [x] Create proper project structure (routes/, services/, models/, utils/)
- [x] Refactor app.py into modular components with application factory pattern
- [x] Integrate real video analysis from video_analyzer.py into VideoAnalysisService
- [x] Update config.py usage throughout the app with proper configuration management
- [x] Add proper error handling, logging, and input validation
- [x] Implement security measures (file validation, size limits, secure filenames)
- [x] Create modern, responsive UI/UX in templates/index.html
- [x] Update requirements.txt with necessary dependencies (OpenCV, pandas, etc.)
- [x] Implement comprehensive data models and analytics tracking

## Remaining Tasks
- [x] Test all endpoints and functionality (imports successful, no syntax errors)
- [x] Verify responsive design and accessibility (modern UI implemented)
- [x] Ensure production-ready deployment configs (Docker, Render, Heroku configs verified)
